About
-----
This is a "Tech Demo" for a 2D Adventure/Platform Game.


Compiling
---------

Linux(GCC):
$ gcc -std=c99 <files> -o main `sdl-config --cflags --libs` -lSDL_image

Windows:
If you are using MSVC make sure to compile the project as CPP, since MSVC does not implement the C99 Standard.
You can also compile with Code::Blocks and MinGW32, again add the -std=99 option, there are still random crashes though and the program takes longer to start than with MSVC.
