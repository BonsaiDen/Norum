  This is a "Tech Demo" for a 2D Adventure/Platform Game.


Compiling
---------

  Linux(GCC):
    First off you need to install libsdl/sdl_image and the corresponding devel 
    packages via your packet manager.
    
    # Editor
    $ gcc -std=c99 -D EDITOR -Iheaders sources/*.c -o edit  `sdl-config --cflags --libs` -lSDL_image
    
    # Game
    $ gcc -std=c99 -Iheaders `find sources -type f -name "*.c" -not -name "editor.c"` -o main  `sdl-config --cflags --libs` -lSDL_image
    
  Windows:
    If you are using MSVC make sure to compile the project as CPP, since MSVC 
    does not implement the C99 Standard.
    
    You can also compile with Code::Blocks and MinGW32, again add the -std=99 
    option, there are still random crashes though and the program takes longer 
    to start than with MSVC.

  Mac:
    I dont' have one.
